# Neural networks and deep learning
This repo holds the code I write as I teach myself about neural networks and deep learning. Right now I'm working through [this excellent free ebook](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) by Michael Nielsen, but I plan to explore [other](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/) [resources](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) at some point in the future. Note that there is an [official repo](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", which I have declined to fork, preferring instead to write the code myself, using the codebase from the book (heavily) for guidance.
